I left to research the ancient technology, but nothing of note came of my research. 
The return of Ganon loomsâ€”a dark force taunting us from afar. 
I must learn all I can about the relics so we can stop him. 
If the fortune-teller's prophecy is to be believed, there isn't much time left... 
Ah, but turning over these thoughts in my head puts me ill at ease. 
I suppose I should turn in for the night.

P.S. Tomorrow my father is assigning HIM as my appointed knight...", author_id: zelda.id, notebook_id: botw_notebook.id })

I still recall feeling his eyes on me as I walked ahead. 
The feeling stayed with me so long, I grew anxious and weary. 
It is the same feeling I've felt before in his company... 
And still, not a word passes his lips. I never know what he's thinking! 
It makes my imagination run wild, guessing at what he is thinking but will not say. 
What does the boy chosen by the sword that seals the darkness think of me? Will I ever truly know? Then, I suppose it's simple. 
A daughter of Hyrule's royal family yet unable to use sealing magic... He must despise me.",

Though I've been cold to him all this time...taking my selfish and childish anger out on him at every turn... Still, he was there for me. I won't ever forget that.

When I finally got around to asking why he's so quiet all the time, I could tell it was difficult for him to say. But he did. With so much at stake, and so many eyes upon him, he feels it necessary to stay strong and to silently bear any burden. A feeling I know all too well... For him, it has caused him to stop outwardly expressing his thoughts and feelings. I always believed him to be simply a gifted person who had never faced a day of hardship. How wrong I was... Everyone has struggles that go unseen by the world... I was so absorbed with my own problems, I failed to see his. I wish to talk with him more and to see what lies beneath those calm waters, to hear him speak freely and openly... And perhaps I, too, will be able to bare my soul to him and share the demons that have plagued me all these years.",

He insisted that I focus instead on training that will help me awaken my sealing magic. I was so frustrated and ashamed I could not even speak. I've been training since I was a child, and yet... Mother passed the year before my training was to begin. In losing her, I lost not just a mother, but a teacher. Mother used to smile and tell me, \"Zelda, my love, all will be well in the end. You can do anything.\" But she was wrong. No matter how I try or how much time passes...the sealing power that is my birthright evades me. Tomorrow I journey with Link to the Spring of Power to train. But this, too, will end in failure. Such is my curse.",
