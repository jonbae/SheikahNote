I left to research the ancient technology, but nothing of note came of my research. 
The return of Ganon loomsâ€”a dark force taunting us from afar. 
I must learn all I can about the relics so we can stop him. 
If the fortune-teller's prophecy is to be believed, there isn't much time left... 
Ah, but turning over these thoughts in my head puts me ill at ease. 
I suppose I should turn in for the night.

P.S. Tomorrow my father is assigning HIM as my appointed knight...", author_id: zelda.id, notebook_id: botw_notebook.id })

I still recall feeling his eyes on me as I walked ahead. 
The feeling stayed with me so long, I grew anxious and weary. 
It is the same feeling I've felt before in his company... 
And still, not a word passes his lips. I never know what he's thinking! 
It makes my imagination run wild, guessing at what he is thinking but will not say. 
What does the boy chosen by the sword that seals the darkness think of me? Will I ever truly know? Then, I suppose it's simple. 
A daughter of Hyrule's royal family yet unable to use sealing magic... He must despise me." ,author_id: zelda.id, notebook_id: botw_notebook.id })
